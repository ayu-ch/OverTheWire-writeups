# **Level 4**
In this level, there is an inhere directory again.
We can change our current directory by using `cd inhere`.

We can see multiple files here starting from '-file'/

There is a command called as `file`
>File command gives us details about the files. Usage: file {filename}
For example, we can see the output of `file ./-file00` it says data.

If you try printing the file using `cat ./-file00` it wont give any output.

You can check the file details of all the files by using `file ./-*`.

Using this, you can see that one of them is an `ASCII text`.

You can print the file to get the password:)
