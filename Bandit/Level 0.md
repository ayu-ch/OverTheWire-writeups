We have to connect the to level0 with ssh by using 
`ssh bandit0@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p2220` (because the username is bandit0)

It will ask for a password which will not be visible while typing. For this level , it is bandit0

You are spawned in a remote shell, here if you try to list the files in the current directory by using `ls`

You'll find a readme file , if you print it out using the `cat` command. It will give you the password for the next level.

Make sure to store it in a txt file locally so that you dont lose it for going to other levels.

After getting the password, just write exit.
