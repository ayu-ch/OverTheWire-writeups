# **Level 9**
This level needs the usage of the `strings` command.

The `strings` is just like cat but it is used to print out only human-readable/ascii characters only!

so we can find our password by using the following command : `strings data.txt | grep ==` (used 'grep ==' because we were told the password is next to multiple '='s)
