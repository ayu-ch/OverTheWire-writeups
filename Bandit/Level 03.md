# **Level 3**
In this level, there is a directory called as `inhere`

We can go to that directory by using `cd inhere`. If we try to list the files by using `ls` we will see no output:(

The ls command does not shows files which start with a '.' . Such files are called as hidden files.

To view them we have to use the command `ls -a`. You can then see there is a file called `.hidden`.

Use `cat .hidden` to get the passwd
