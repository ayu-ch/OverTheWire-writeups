# **Level 02**
In this level, you can see a file with the name `spaces in this filename`.

To print the file, you cannot use the command `cat spaces in this filename` because linux treats words after space as different commands/arguments.

We can either use the command `cat spaces\ in\ this\ filename` or `cat 'spaces in this filename'`

This way, you will get the passwd, save it and use it for the next level:)
